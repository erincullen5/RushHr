### Our project will be completing a comparitive analysis of Divvy and Ridesharing data. We will be looking specifically at the City of Chicago commuters during Rush Hour. 

### **At the base level:** 
   - What is the most cost efficient option and time efficient option for commuting during rush hour?
    - More deep analysis of what is the most prefered and efficient method of commutting. 
    - How do start and end points determine preferences and efficency towards Divvy v.s. Ride Share. 

### **Data Sets Used**
 - We will use the Divvy quarterly data available on their website, which contains station data as well as ride data. 
- For Ridesharing data, we will look at either Uber or Lyft.
